                                CFDs are financial instruments that are traded on margin, enabling investors and traders to participate in the movement of
                                shares and index prices without having the ownership of the underlying asset. CFDs are a complex financial product and are not suitable for all investors. If you are unsure of the risks or of whether you have sufficient financial resources or experience to trade these products, you should not begin trading with us. "CFDs" are highly risky due to the speculative and volatile markets in these products and the leverage (margin) involved. Trading these products may result in loss of funds greater than you deposited in the account. <em><strong>You must carefully consider your financial circumstances and risk tolerance before trading CFDs. CFD trading is an activity that carries a high risk to your capital. Don’t use money you can’t afford to lose.</strong></em>

                                Our products offer various levels of leverage. Before trading, we shall ask you to make an initial deposit. Each product we offer has a margin requirement. Based on this requirement and your initial deposit, you shall be able to trade a contract value in excess of your funds. For example, a margin requirement of 5% would enable you to trade contracts 20 times as large as your deposit. Fluctuations in asset prices will therefore be magnified many times. A small price movement against you may result in a larger loss. Using leverage or margin means that you may lose more than you have actually deposited in your account if the price of the CFD moves significantly against you.

                                (for example those where CFDs are traded), you, on making an initial investment, puts up a sum of cash
                                (the margin) which represents a percentage of the value of the investment. If the price of the investment subsequently
                                fluctuates, you may be called upon to put up extra cash (a margin call).

                                We, and/or our representatives, may from time to time carry out transactions on your behalf in securities subject to stabilisation.
                                Stabilisation enables the market price of a security to be maintained artificially during the period when a new issue of securities
                                is sold to the public. Stabilisation may affect not only the price of the new issue but also the price of other securities relating to it.

                                Shares are available in companies of different sizes, Cero sectors, geographical locations, and on different stock markets.
                                Liquidity is an important risk factor when investing in individual equities and is generally driven by the market capitalisation
                                (total value of issued shares) of the company and current market conditions. Liquidity levels can change rapidly and lack of
                                liquidity often restricts trading in equities with smaller market capitalisations (known as mid cap and small cap).

                                Information on overseas investments is not as readily available to the public as for companies and the financial pages of the
                                national press give little coverage of the subject. Different time zones also mean that you will not always be able to get a real time
                                price for overseas stocks during the trading day. When investing in overseas markets, currency fluctuations need to be taken into account.
                                A gain or loss made on the performance of a stock can easily be offset by a movement in the currency exchange rate. Alternatively a gain or
                                loss on a stock could be compounded to make an even larger one. Liquidity considerations are similar to  shares.

                                The price of individual shares can fluctuate considerably and can appreciate or decline rapidly.
                                Shares can also remain in decline over long time periods. Share prices rise and fall according to the
                                health of the company and general economic and market conditions. Individual share price rises and falls
                                can be significant. Stock market investments tend to be more volatile than investments in most bonds.

                                Shares purchased on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) (especially those known as ‘penny shares’) carry a higher degree of
                                risk of losing money than other shares. This is because the requirements on companies that are listed on AIM are less stringent
                                than those for companies with a full market listing. There is also usually a wider spread between the buying price and the selling
                                price of these shares and if they have to be sold immediately, you may get back less than you paid for them due to a lack of liquidity.
                                The price of these shares may change quickly and they may go down as well as up. It may also be difficult to obtain reliable information
                                about their value or the extent of the risks to which they are exposed.
